These same sources estimate ADF’s total membership — including women and children — to be between 1,600 and 2,500.  Due to offensive military operations by the Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC) and MONUSCO conducted in 2013 and 2014, ADF has dispersed its fighters to numerous smaller bases, and moved women and children to areas west of Beni, and along the Ituri-North Kivu border.",,NALU,,,"The ADF has recruited and used child soldiers in violation of applicable international law (UNSCR paragraph 4 (d)). The United Nations Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (""GOE"") 2013 final report stated that the GOE interviewed three former ADF fighters who had escaped during 2013 and who described how ADF recruiters in Uganda lure people to the DRC with false promises of employment (for adults) and free education (for children) and then force them to join the ADF. Also according to the GOE’s report, former ADF fighters told the GOE that the ADF’s training groups typically include adult men and boys and two boys who escaped from the ADF in 2013 told the GOE that they had received military training from the ADF. The GOE report also includes an account of ADF’s training by a “former ADF child soldier”. According to the GOE’s 2012 final report, the ADF recruits include children, as exemplified by the case of an ADF recruiter who was captured by Ugandan authorities in Kasese with six young boys on his way to the DRC in Jul 2012. A specific example of the ADF’s recruitment and use of children is seen in a 6 Jan 2009 letter from the former Africa Director for Human Rights Watch, Georgette Gagnon, to Uganda’s former Minister of Justice, Kiddhu Makubuyu, stating that a boy named Bushobozi Irumba was abducted at 9 years of age by the ADF in 2000. He was required to provide transport and other services to ADF fighters. In addition, “The Africa Report” cited allegations that the ADF is allegedly recruiting children as young as 10 years of age as child soldiers and cited a Uganda People’s Defence Force (UPDF) spokesperson as stating that the UPDF rescued 30 children from a training camp on Buvuma Island in Lake Victoria.",,2018-04-12 07:31:43.214770

In addition, this group has been explicitly singled out by resolutions 2127, 2134 and 2149 for such acts. Yakete has been accused of ordering the arrest of people connected to the Séléka, calling for attacks on people who do not support President Bozizé, and recruiting young militiamen to attack those hostile to the regime with machetes. Having remained in the entourage of François Bozizé after March 2013, he joined the Front for the Return to Constitutional Order in CAR (Front pour le Retour à l’Ordre Constitutionnel en CentrAfrique — FROCCA), which aimed to return the deposed president to power by whatever means necessary. In late summer 2013, he travelled to Cameroon and Benin, where he attempted to recruit people to fight against the Séléka. In September 2013, he tried to regain control over operations led by pro-Bozizé fighters in towns and villages near to Bossangoa.
